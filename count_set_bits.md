Editorial: ğŸ’¡ Count Set Bits
X
With bitwise operations, we can use an algorithm whose running time depends on the number of ones present in the binary form of the given number.


int count_set_nits (int n)
    {
        while( n > 0)
        {
        n = n&(n-1);
           count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
How does this algorithm work? We can observe that there is a relationship between a number N and N-1. N-1 will have all the bits same as x except for the rightmost 1 in x and all the bits to the right of rightmost 1 in x. So as in x-1, the rightmost 1 and bits right to it is flipped, then by performing x&(x-1), and storing it in x, will reduce x to a number containing number of ones(in its binary form) less than the previous state of x, thus increasing the value of count in each iteration. This is also known as Brian Kernighan Algorithm.

Lang - Java

public static int count_set_nits (int n){
        while( n > 0){
             n = n&(n-1);
             count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
