Editorial: ðŸ’¡ Highest frequency( Hashing )

For this problem we will prepare the frequency hashmap where we will store the element as the key and how many times that element is present in the array.
Then we will iterate over the hashmap and extract the element with the maximum frequency from the array.

Algorithm

1 . Iterate over the whole array.
2 . We will save the frequency of every element of the array.
3 . Then we will iterate over the hashmap and check for every key in the hashmap if it has the maximum frequency or not.
4 . Then we will return the key with the maximum frequency
