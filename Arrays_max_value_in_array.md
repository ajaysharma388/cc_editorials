Editorial: ðŸ’¡ Arrays-Max Value In Array

For the case arr= {20, 10, 20, 4, 100}, max element is 100.

Time complexity : o(n), where n is the size of the array. Worst case is when max element is present at the end of the array.

Algorithm:

1.Initialize max variable with minimum value of integer or with 0th element of the array say arr.
2.Iterate over each element of the array
2.1 if arr[i] > max then // updating max when the array element at ith location is greater than max
max=arr[i]
3.After end of the loop max is having the maximum element of the array.
4.Print max.
